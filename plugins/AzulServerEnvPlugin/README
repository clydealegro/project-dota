AzulServerEnv Plugin
====================

Author: Reynaldo Castellano III
Version: 1.0

The primary purpose of this plugin is to provide configurations that are server specific.
For example the database host used when connecting to the database is based on the server environment that the code is running.
If the server is a local development environment, the database should point to the local database server.

Installation:
=============
	* Place a copy of the AzulServerEnv plugin to the plugin folder of your symfony project.
	* Activate the plugin.
	* Create a server_env.yml file in the config directory of your symfony project. A sample file is provided in config directory of the plugin.
	* You are done!
	
Usage:
======
	You can access the configuration values through the AzulServerEnv class. For example, you have a 'db_host' configuration for all server environment, accessing the 
	that configuration value would be:
		
		$dbHost = AzulServerEnv::getInstance()->get('db_host');
	
	The logic for determining the current server environment is encapsulated within the plugin. There are currently 2 server environment types supported by the plugin, 
	the 'local' and 'production' server environments.
